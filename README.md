# SinTheta_Aug2025

Analysis of neutrino physics data for sin²θ_W measurements and related studies.

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for analyzing neutrino interaction data, specifically focusing on:

- sin²θ_W (Weinberg angle) measurements
- Neutrino flavor ratio analysis  
- NC/CC (Neutral Current/Charged Current) interaction studies
- High-energy neutrino physics
